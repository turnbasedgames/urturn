### What

- Semantle Battle is a spin off of the original semantle game where two players pick secrets for one another to guess. The player who guesses the secret first wins.
- Play it with a friend [here](https://www.urturn.app/games/63474d0012b461000e15dc96) to prepare before the tournament.

### When

- Tournament will be hosted **Saturday 11/5/2022 2:00 PM PST**.
- RSVP in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/myWacjdb5S) as soon as possible, we will cap the number of participants.

### Where

Always [Discord](https://discord.gg/9hpzbEba?event=1037129035651751997).

### How

Entry is **Free**.

#### Tournament Structure

- We will auto generate a random bracket with every player that RSVPs in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/myWacjdb5S).
- All games will be screen shared (each player will share their screen in two separate channels) to ensure no cheating.
- Each player starts out on their own and are their own **team leader** (i.e. each team will have 1 player at the first round).
- When a team wins, the two teams combine and the new team leader is the **team leader of the winning team**. Eventually the last Semantle Battle will be between two large teams.
- Only the team leader can type in guesses. Teams will not have access to the other teams voice chat/text channel.

#### Prizes

- Team leader of last team standing gets the only ultimate tournament winner discord role.
- Players on the winning team will get a tournament winner discord role.

#### Rules

- No Cheating of any form (you will be disqualified immediately, banned from the discord server, and the UrTurn platform - seriously don't ruin the fun of others).
- The winner is chosen based on the player in this order of priority:
  - player who guessed the word first
  - closest word index-wise (e.g. 99th word in nearest list is better than 70th word in nearest list)
  - closest word similarity score-wise
- Each game you have 30 seconds to provide your secret and 5 minutes to guess the other player's secret. At the end of the 5 minutes, a winner is chosen.
