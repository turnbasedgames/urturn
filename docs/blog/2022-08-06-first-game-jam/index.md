## Prompt

> Every Great Journey has a beginning. In a few days, Urturn will embark on a new beginning, our first game jam, and we are so excited to see what yâ€™all create. Making games has always been personal for me; it has exposed me to the amazing world of programming has given me freedoms and abilities that I never fathomed. I want to share those experiences with you. Therefore, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our very first Urturn Game Jam! - Kevin
