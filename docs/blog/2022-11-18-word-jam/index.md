## Prompt

> Words. We use them to communicate. We use them to make jokes with silly puns. We tell stories with them to inspire others, to express ourselves. We arrange them in many ways. Sometimes we use them to provide odd abstract prompts for a game jam on a thanksgiving weekend.
>
> What are words? Do they mean the same to you as they do to me? What does it mean to understand - to stand under?
