# Semantle Battle

Okay so [Multiplayer TicTacToe](/docs/Getting-Started/tictactoe) was *too easy* for you.

:::success

You want to make something **more advanced**. Play Semantle Battle [Here](https://www.urturn.app/games/63474d0012b461000e15dc96).

Ask yourself:

- What do you do when a user inputs a word?
- How do you control multiple phases of a game?
- There is no concept of a *turn* in this game. Players can asynchronously update the state by making guesses in any order. How do we handle this?

Let's walk through the implementation of this and how UrTurn can even make a game like this **easy**.
