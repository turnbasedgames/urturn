# Saving Player Data

:::caution

Gamification is important. Players want to be able to track their progress across games. The implementation of this work will allow you to modify player data in a transactional manner while modifying your room state.

You will be able to do several things:

1. Players can have an inventory of items across different rooms
2. Score and potentially rating in the future of a Player
3. Any other things you can think of.
4. Limit will be 15MB worth of data!

This work is planned. Join [discord](https://discord.gg/myWacjdb5S) to provide more details on your use case.
