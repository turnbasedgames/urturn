# Self Hosting UrTurn

Dead dependencies can be costly. First, UrTurn developers are fully committed to this project and we aim to provide the best game developer experience.

In the unlikely case, **where we are crippled financially** (unlikely because Kevin survives off of rice and beans at the moment), we still want game developers (especially indie developers) to have self hosting options.

This project is first and foremost for game developers.

This work is planned. Join [discord](https://discord.gg/myWacjdb5S) to provide more details on your use case. We **guarantee** instructions are posted in the case we become insolvent.
