# Flow of a Simple Game

## Basic architecture

This diagram shows 4 systems. You control the `game frontend` and the `game backend`. UrTurn controls the `runner` and `client`.

![architecture diagram](./everything_diagram.png)

For you, it will feel like your game frontend is seamlessly communicating directly with your backend.

:::caution

**The user is able to control the game frontend.**
This means critical game logic should always be in the backend (e.g. validation of user data, handling transition of state, etc.), which is managed by our cloud servers.

## TicTacToe

Let's walk through a simple TicTacToe game that you made:

### 1. Player `Billy` clicks **Play**

[![billy clicks play](./click_play_button_tictactoe.gif)](./click_play_button_tictactoe.gif)

UrTurn calls your function implementation of `onRoomStart` to initialize the room state.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="result" label="Initial roomState" default>

```json
{
  "joinable": true, // defaults to true, (when set to false, UrTurn prevents any new players from joining the room)
  "finished": false, // defaults to false, (when set to true, UrTurn prevents any new moves from being made)
  "state": { // this field can be any JSON object that you define. This was defined by the function above.
    "status": "preGame",
    "board": [
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ]
    ],
    "winner": null,
  },
  "version": 0, // metadata controlled by UrTurn; as each new `RoomState` gets created, this gets incremented by 1
  "players": [], // metadata controlled by UrTurn; when a player joins the room, they are added here to the list. When they quit the room, they are removed.
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onRoomStart" label="onRoomStart code">

```js title="index.js"
function onRoomStart() {
  return {
    state: {
      status: Status.PreGame,
      board: [
        [null, null, null],
        [null, null, null],
        [null, null, null],
      ],
      winner: null, // null means tie if game is finished, otherwise set to the plr that won,
    },
  };
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

UrTurn calls `onPlayerJoin` function with `Billy` player object and the previous `roomState` created earlier.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="result" label="roomState result" default>

```json
{
  "joinable": true, // room should still let players join because there are not enough players to play tictactoe yet
  "finished": false,
  "state": {
    "status": "preGame",
    "board": [
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ]
    ],
    "winner": null
  },
  // highlight-start
  "version": 1, // incremented because we applied another roomState operation
  "players": [ // new player is in the player list
    {
      "id": "id_0",
      "username": "billy"
    }
  ]
  // highlight-end
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onPlayerJoin" label="onPlayerJoin Code">

```js title="index.js"
function onPlayerJoin(player, roomState) {
  const { players, state } = roomState;
  if (players.length === 2) { // enough players to play the game
    state.status = Status.InGame;
    state.plrToMoveIndex = 0; // keep track of who’s turn it is
    return { // return modifications we want to make to the roomState
      state,
      joinable: false, // we should not allow new players to join the game, tictactoe only needs two players
    };
  }
  // our first player joined, we should do nothing (not enough players yet to start).
  return {};
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Updates are propagated to clients by sending an event to `client.events.on('stateChanged')` so your game frontend can update the view for the player.

[![billy waiting](./tictactoe_1_billy_waiting.png)](./tictactoe_1_billy_waiting.png)

### 2. Player `Sarah` clicks **Play**

UrTurn matchmaking system puts `Sarah` to the same room as `Billy`.

The same function `onPlayerJoin` is called with `Sarah` player object and the previous `roomState`, which produces the result (changes are highlighted):

```json
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "joinable": false, // no longer joinable as we have enough players!
  "finished": false,
  "state": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "status": "inGame", // game is now in game and we can start playing!
    "board": [
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ]
    ],
    "winner": null,
    "plrToMoveIndex": 0
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  "version": 2,
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "id_0",
      "username": "billy"
    },
    // highlight-start
    { // new player "sarah", added by UrTurn runner
      "id": "id_1",
      "username": "sarah"
    }
    // highlight-end
  ]
}
```

Updates are propagated to all clients:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Sarah" label="Sarah's browser" default>

[![sarah joins](./tictactoe_2_sarah_joined.png)](./tictactoe_2_sarah_joined.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Billy" label="Billy's browser">

[![sarah joins billy view](./tictactoe_2_sarah_joined_billy_view.png)](./tictactoe_2_sarah_joined_billy_view.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. `Billy` puts `X` in top left corner

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Billy moves" label="Billy's browser" default>

[![billy moves](./tictactoe_3_billy_moves.gif)](./tictactoe_3_billy_moves.gif)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sarah" label="Sarah's browser">

[![billy moves sarah view](./tictactoe_3_billy_moves_sarah_view.gif)](./tictactoe_3_billy_moves_sarah_view.gif)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your frontend calls `client.makeMove({ x: 0, y: 0 })` whenever it detected `billy` clicking a button on the board

:::info

The `client.makeMove` function takes any move JSON!

:::

UrTurn calls `onPlayerMove` function to handle the arbitrary move:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="result" label="roomState result">

Resulting `roomState` (changes are highlighted):

```json
{
  "joinable": false,
  "finished": false,
  "state": {
    "status": "inGame",
    "board": [
      [
        // highlight-next-line
        "X", // Billy’s move!
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ],
      [
        null,
        null,
        null
      ]
    ],
    "winner": null,
    // highlight-next-line
    "plrToMoveIndex": 1 // next move is Sarah’s
  },
  // highlight-next-line
  "version": 3,
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "id_0",
      "username": "billy"
    },
    {
      "id": "id_1",
      "username": "sarah"
    }
  ]
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onRoomStart" label="onRoomStart code">

```js title="index.js"
function onPlayerMove(player, move, boardGame) {
  const { state, players } = boardGame;
  const { board, plrToMoveIndex } = state;
  const { x, y } = move;
  if (state.status !== Status.InGame) { // boardgame must be in the game (clients may spoof and send onPlayerMove with whatever values they want!)
    throw new Error("game is not in progress, can't make move!"); // error will be propagated to the client.makeMove() call
  }
  if (players[plrToMoveIndex].id !== player.id) { // make sure it is the player’s turn
    throw new Error(`Its not this player's turn: ${player.username}`);
  }
  if (board[x][y] !== null) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid move, someone already marked here: ${x},${y}`);
  }

  board[x][y] = players[0].id === player.id ? ‘X’ : ‘O’; // set the board square to the correct mark;

  // game may be finished
  // logic is too long to show here, but checks if an “three marks in a row” or if no more possible moves left
  const [isEnd, winner] = isEndGame(board, players);
  if (isEnd) {
    // transitions game to end
    state.status = Status.EndGame;
    state.winner = winner;
    return { state, finished: true }; // game is now finished, modify the “finished” metadata so UrTurn can properly catalogue this room
  }

  // alternate the current player move so next player can make a move
  state.plrToMoveIndex = plrToMoveIndex === 0 ? 1 : 0;
  return { state };
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Your backend is just a group of `pure functions`

Notice how all of the implemented functions `onRoomStart`, `onPlayerJoin`, etc. takes in the current state and several other arguments and returns the resulting state after applying the operation.

This makes it easier to understand, debug, and test your entire backend. More on [pure functions](/docs/api/backend#pure-functions).

## Getting the hang of it?

:::success

Notice how you are only responsible for defining **how states change** with each operation. UrTurn takes care of the rest.

Try implementing the entire [TicTacToe game](/docs/getting-started/tictactoe) and deploying it to production so anyone can play it!
